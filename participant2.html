        <h2>Who is Keith?</h2>
        <p>I live in Seeta, Mukono and my home district is Manafwa. I am a lover of choral music and I do train choirs and sing with them in my free time. I sing with Glorious Queen Choir Seeta and All Saints Catholic Choir Seeta all at St. Augustine Seeta Catholic Parish. </p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p> I am currently a student at Victoria University doing Business Computing with the hopes of earning a living out of my computer skills as i apply them in the business world.  I do computer repair and maintenance, painting and secretarial services to make ends meet. I work with Samanga Solutions Ltd as a free lance technician and i can attend to anyone in need since i am alway just a call away. I also do choir directing(training) services for schools, churches and any other organisations or individuals that need the services.  </p>
        <h2>Me and my community</h2>
        <p>As a member of the community in which I live, i spend most of my free time doing choral music and helping others to sing well by trainig them. i was also entrusted to take up the leadership of all the choir members at the parish and so I have the chance to serve as a leader at my parish. being that Lugazi Diocese will be leading Namugongo celebrations next year, I am chanced to be one of the music directors who were selected to prepare the choristers who will annimate mass on that day. The preparations are in high gear and we have moved atleast a visible journey as we have been having practices and rehearsals both at parish and diocesan levels. We are very hopeful that we shall be able to lead the celebrations successfully come next year.  .</p>
